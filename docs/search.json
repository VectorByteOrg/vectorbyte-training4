    "text": "Main materials\n\nPre-workshop\nWe will be using R for all data manipulation and analyses/model fitting. Any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) will do, as long as you have R (version 3.6 or higher) installed.\nYou may use any IDE/ GUI for R (VScode, RStudio, Emacs, etc). For most people, RStudio is a good option. Whichever one you decide to use, please make sure it is installed and test it before the workshop. We will have a channel on Slack dedicated to software/hardware issues and troubleshooting.\nWe will also be using Slack to facilitate the synchronous portions of the training. Please have these installed in advance. We are assuming familiarity with R basics. In addition, we recommend that you do the following:\n\nGo to The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist, and read+work through the Biological Computing in R Chapter up to the section on Writing R code. Of course, keep going if you want (although we will cover some similar materials here).\nReview background on introductory probability and statistics (solutions to exercises)\n\nOnce you have completed the pre-work and set-up tasks, you should get yourself familiar with the VectorByte Training materials. You will choose a starting point based on your previous experience. This will be in the form of slack channels labeled based on interest. From there you will group yourself (based on whatever you like, but keep in mind time zones and language preferences) and a demonstrator will be matched with your group.\nMuch of the synchronous time is planned to be dedicated to helping you work through exercises and activities. Thus you’ll want to watch the videos and take a look at the slides off line (likely starting earlier in the week for most participants).

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the VectorByte team has developed these materials, we’ve aimed to provide resources for both guided (during the workshop) and self-led learning. We assume basic familiarity with:\n\nThe R Programming Language\nBasic calculus (especially the mathematical idea of functions)\nBasic probability and statistics (e.g., what is a probability distribution, normal and binomial distributions, means, variances)\n\nWe’ve divided the materials into subject matter modules, and categorized these loosely from beginner to advanced methods. Each module is designed to build on the previous one, and expects at least knowledge of all of the preceding modules in the sequence. Based on your experience, we encourage students to “choose your own adventure” and start from where you feel comfortable.\nEach module consists of four kinds of materials:\n\nslides with presentation of materials\nvideos with recorded lectures based on slides\nlabs/hands-on materials to allow you to practice material in a practical way\nsolutions to exercises, when necessary\n\nWe also include links to additional resources/materials/references.\nFor more information about the goals and approach of the VectorByte RCN are available at vectorbyte.org."

We are glad you asked! VectorBiTE was an RCN or a research coordination network funded by a 5 year grant from the BBSRC. VectorByte is hosting this training which is a newly funded NSF grant to establish a global open access data platform to study disease vectors. All the databases have transitioned to VectorByte but the legacy options will still be available on the VectorBiTE website.↩︎"
