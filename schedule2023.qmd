# Pre-workshop

We will be using [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) for all data manipulation and analyses/model fitting. Any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) will do, as long as you have `R` (version 3.6 or higher) installed.

You may use any IDE/ GUI for `R` (VScode, RStudio, Emacs, etc). For most people, [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a good option. Whichever one you decide to use, please make sure it is installed and test it before the workshop. We will have a channel on Slack dedicated to software/hardware issues and troubleshooting.

We will also be using Slack for additional support during the training. Please have these installed in advance. We are assuming familiarity with `R` basics. In addition, we recommend that you do the following:

1.  Go to [The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html), and read+work through the [Biological Computing in R Chapter](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/notebooks/07-R.html) up to the section on Writing `R` code. Of course, keep going if you want (although we will cover some similar materials here).

2.  Review background on [introductory probability and statistics](Stats_review.qmd) ([solutions to exercises](Stats_review_soln.qmd))

Once you have completed the pre-work and set-up tasks, you should get yourself familiar with the [VectorByte Training materials](materials.html).

Although there will be input at the start of most sessions, much of the synchronous time is planned to be dedicated to helping you work through exercises and activities
